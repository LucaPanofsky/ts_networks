# Propagation Networks in TypeScript

A TypeScript implementation of propagation networks, a computational model based on accumulating partial information through a network of cells and propagators.

## Building Blocks

### Core Information Structures

An **information structure** is the blueprint for any value in the model. Every value — including `null`, errors, and plain data — is wrapped in an information structure.

All information structures implement:

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `content` | `() → A` | Returns the wrapped value |
| `equals` | `(other) → boolean` | Structural equality, used by `merge` |
| `unpack` | `(f: A → B) → InfoStructure` | Apply `f` to the content (like `map`) |
| `flatten` | `() → InfoStructure` | Remove one level of nesting |
| `bind` | `(f: A → InfoStructure) → InfoStructure` | `unpack` then `flatten` (like `flatMap`) |
| `merge` | `(other) → InfoStructure` | Combine two information structures |

The primary algebraic operation is **`merge`**. Together with `Nothing` as the identity element, the information structures form a **commutative monoid** under merge:

- **Idempotent**: `merge(a, a) = a`
- **Commutative**: `merge(a, b) = merge(b, a)`
- **Associative**: `merge(merge(a, b), c) = merge(a, merge(b, c))`

### The Type Hierarchy

Values are ordered by how much information they carry:

```
Nothing  <  Something(v)  <  Contradiction
  (none)      (a value)       (inconsistency)
```

| Type | Represents | `merge` behaviour |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `Nothing` | absence of information (identity element) | always returns `other` |
| `Something<A>` | a concrete value | returns self if equal to `other`, else `Contradiction` |
| `Contradiction` | an inconsistency (absorbing element) | always returns self |

### The `I` function

`I(value)` is the entry point that lifts any raw JavaScript value into an information structure:

```typescript
I(null)          // → Nothing
I(undefined)     // → Nothing
I(new Error())   // → Contradiction("runtime/error", {}, error)
I(42)            // → Something(42)
I("hello")       // → Something("hello")
```

### The Network Language

Networks can be declared in a small DSL that compiles to a `DataNetwork`. A network definition names its inputs and output via a `signature`, then lists cells, constants, and propagators as terms.

```
defnetwork doubleAndAdd
  signature: from [x] to out;
  constant bias = 10;
  propagate double from [x] to doubled;
  propagate add from [doubled, bias] to out;
end
```

| Term | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `signature: from […] to name;` | Declares the network's interface |
| `cell name = value;` | Declares a cell with an initial value |
| `constant name = value;` | Declares a read-only cell |
| `propagate fn from […] to name;` | Adds a propagator that calls `fn` |
| `propagate fn from […] to name with: k=v, …;` | Propagator with named parameters |

Function names in `propagate` are looked up in a `Registry` at compile time and wrapped with `naryUnpacking` to produce the runtime `Propagator`.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  info-structure.ts   — InfoStructure<A> interface + all core types
                        (Nothing, Something<A>, Contradiction, I)
  index.ts            — public re-exports
tests/
  algebraic-properties-1.test.ts  — ACI laws for merge
```

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # compile TypeScript → dist/
npm test        # run all tests
npm run dev     # watch mode
```

## Editor Support

### VS Code extension (`editors/vscode/`)

A minimal, **highlighting-only** VS Code extension for `.tsn` files. It is purely
declarative — a TextMate grammar plus a language configuration, with **no
language server and no compiled code**. It is not yet packaged or published; you
install it locally from the repo.

**Current state:** syntax highlighting only. It colours definition keywords
(`defnetwork`, `defrecord`, `defn`, `defpredicate`, `defllmfn`, `defgrammar`,
`defenum`, `derive`), structural keywords (`signature`, `from`, `to`,
`propagate`, `switch`, `match`, `when`, `let`, …), single-quoted strings,
triple-quoted `"""…"""` blocks (prompts and `defgrammar` bodies), `//` comments,
numbers, booleans, operators, Capitalized types/constructors, and namespaced
calls (`str/…`, `network/…`). There is **no** error checking, hover,
go-to-definition, or other LSP behaviour.

**Caveat:** this TextMate grammar is **independent** of the Lezer grammar in
`src/data-network/grammar.grammar` (VS Code cannot consume Lezer). The two are
maintained separately; the keyword list is the only thing that must be kept in
sync when the language changes.

**Install (local):** symlink the folder into your VS Code extensions directory
and reload the window:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/editors/vscode" ~/.vscode/extensions/tsn-syntax-0.0.1
```

See `editors/vscode/README.md` for details and for packaging a `.vsix`.

## Other Types

### `MergeObject` & plain objects

A plain object wrapped with `I({ x: 1 })` becomes `Something({ x: 1 })`. Its `merge` is **base semantics**: two `Something` values merge successfully only if they are identical; any difference produces a `Contradiction`. There is no awareness of fields.

`MergeObject` lifts each field of the object individually into its own `InfoStructure`, enabling **recursive merge semantics**: two `MergeObject`s merge field by field, unioning keys that appear in only one side and merging values that appear in both. A conflict in a single field bubbles up as a `Contradiction` for the whole object.

This makes `MergeObject` a safe accumulator for partial information: different propagators can each contribute a subset of fields, and the cell will accumulate them without conflict as long as no field is asserted twice with different values.

**Functional behaviour is equivalent.** Both `Something({x:1})` and `MergeObject.lift({x:1})` deliver the same plain object `{x:1}` to a `bind` or `naryUnpacking` function. The distinction is purely in how `merge` treats incoming information.
